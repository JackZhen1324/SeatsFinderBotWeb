			<div class=""><p>Need help with Python problem:</p>
<p>Write a <strong>recursive</strong> function
<strong>f</strong><strong>ilePrint</strong>() that takes as
parameters a pathname of a folder as a string and an integer indent
and <strong>prints</strong> to the screen the pathname of every
file contained in the folder, directly or indirectly. The file path
names should be output with an indentation that is proportional to
their depth with respect to the topmost folder and should use the
parameter indent to achieve this. You are allowed to use a loop in
this function, but the main work of the function should be done
using recursion.</p>
