<p>1. The figure to the right shows oxygen</p>
<p>consumption following addition of a</p>
<p>preparation of mitochondria to</p>
<p>-hydroxybutyrate dissolved in medium</p>
<p>containing 70 mM sucrose, 220 mM</p>
<p>mannitol, 2 mM HEPES buffer, 5 mM</p>
<p>magnesium chloride, 5 mM potassium</p>
<p>phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% bovine</p>
<p>serum album, pH 7.4 and at 25C. Dissolved</p>
<p>oxygen in the system is measured with an</p>
<p>oxygen electrode.</p>
<p>a. What sequence of reactions is initiated upon the addition of
mitochondria to the system</p>
<p>and results in the rapid consumption of dissolved oxygen as
shown in (a) of the figure?</p>
<p>b. What accounts for the slow rate of oxygen consumption
observed in (b) of the figure?</p>
<p>c. Suggest events that lead to the rapid oxygen consumption upon
addition of 500 nmol of</p>
<p>ADP to the system (part (c) of the figure).</p>
<p>d. What accounts for the slow rate of oxygen consumption
observed in (d) of the figure?</p>
<p>e. In what form is oxygen consumed in parts (a) to (d) of the
figure?</p>
<p>f. How many moles of ATP are synthesized per oxygen atom
consumed?</p>

                    <p>When mitochondria are added utilization of β-hydroxybutyrate
starts.This utilization has following steps:</p>
<p>A). 1st of all β-hydroxybutyrate convert into acetoacetate by
using β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and next convert into
Acetoacetyle CoA by succinyl CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase.This
Acetoacetyle CoA converts into acetyl CoA by thiolase. Acetyl CoA
enters in the normal TCA. NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> enter into the
electron transport chain (ETC)to generate ATP. oxygen is utilized
in ETC and due to active ETC oxygen starts depleting. as shown in
fig a.</p>
<p>B) In ETC, oxygen utilization is coupled with ATP synthesis and
ATP synthesis requires ADP and phosphate as substrate, the active
ETC get slow down as the amount of ADP depleted due to conversion
into ATP (fig b)</p>
<p>C) As the ADP is supplied increase (fig C), the ATP synthesis
increase and the coupled reaction of ETC to use oxygen and
formation of H<sub>2</sub> O increases.</p>
<p>D) With the time the substrate amount remains less due to which
TCA get slow down and resulting in stream reaction also slow down.
And the slow rate of oxygen consumption observed.</p>
