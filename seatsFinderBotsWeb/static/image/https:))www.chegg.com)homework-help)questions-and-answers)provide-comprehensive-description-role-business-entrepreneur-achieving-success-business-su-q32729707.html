		</div></h3><h1>Best Answer:</h1><div class="answer-given-body ugc-base">
                    <p>A business entrepreneur is a person who builds a successful
business model around a product or service which is new and
attempts to solve a problem which has never been done before. The
business entrepreneur is often the person who identifies the
existing problem, develops the idea of a solution and then is
responsible for translating the idea into a full scaled business
with a viable revenue model that successfully solves the problem.
The business entrepreneur is also responsible for raising the funds
required for setting up the new business, marketing the new concept
or idea to potential investors, hiring people to run the business
and overall co-ordination for the entire business. Thus ultimately
it is the business entrepreneur’s ingenuity and his ability to
market the idea that decides the success of the business.</p>
<p>In case of a business man, the person is responsible for running
the business and its success or failure but the business is often
based on an established idea and is not on a new concept on idea.
Thus the fundamental difference between a business entrepreneur and
a business man is that business entrepreneur works on a new concept
and develops a business model around it. While a business man
develops a business but it is not on a novel concept or idea.</p>
